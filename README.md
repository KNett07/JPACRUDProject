#Project Overview -- Kentucky Derby Winners
This weekend's project brings together a variety of technologies and database processes with individual creativity. As an individual we created, implemented, and can manipulate a SQL driven database filled with information that we are curious about. It also brings a new challenge of topic research and incorporating hyperlinks and front end framework with strong foundational back end logic. 

##Technologies Used
Full Stack Dynamic Web Development, APIE, CRUD, Spring WorkBench, Spring Boot, JPA, HTML, and more.

#How To Run
This project can be accessed through an IDE like Eclipse, and the application can be run as a Spring Boot Application. This project was edited via Eclipse, localhost and GitHub, and was then pushed to an AWS platform. Once the website is access the user is able to select a variety of query options centered around Kentucky Derby Winners years 2000-2021. When the full list is viewed, each name is a hyperlink to that winner's personal website. If a horse happens to be later disqualified, they can even be deleted from the database.

##Lessons Learned
This project was a big lesson in individual full stack development. It allowed me to utilize all of my resources and create a cohesive application. It was also a lesson in teamwork and how reaching out for help is vital even in a single setting versus a group. You are never truly alone on any project, and I think that's how we get to create applications that are always evolving and becoming easier for the everyday user.
