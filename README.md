# JPACRUDProject

# Project Overview ------ Kentucky Derby Winners
This project combines a variety of programming technologies and database processes with individuality. In a solo project we created, implemented, and can now manipulate a SQL driven database filled with information that we inserted. It also brings a new challenge of topic research and incorporating additional information with hyperlinks and front end framework with strong foundational back end logic.

## Technologies Used
Full Stack Dynamic Web Development, APIE, CRUD, Spring WorkBench, SQL, Spring Boot, JPA, HTML, and more.

# How To Run
This project can be accessed through an IDE like Eclipse, and the application can be run as a Spring Boot Application. This project was edited with Eclipse and GitHub and was then pushed to an AWS platform. Once the website is accessed the user is able to select a variety of query actions centered around Kentucky Derby Winners years 2000-2021. When the full list is viewed, each name is a hyperlink to that winner's personal website. If a horse happens to be disqualified, they can be deleted from the database.

## Lessons Learned
This project was a big lesson in individual full stack development. It allowed me to utilize all of my resources and create a cohesive application. It was also a lesson in teamwork and how reaching out for help is vital even in a solo setting. You are never truly alone on a project, and I think that's how we get to create applications that are always evolving and becoming more intuitive for every user.
